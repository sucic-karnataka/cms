JAMstack flips traditional web development on its head. Instead of generating pages on a server at request time, everything is pre-built, globally distributed, and served as static files. The result is a web that's faster, cheaper, and vastly more secure.

## What Does JAM Stand For?

JAM is an acronym for **J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup:

- **JavaScript** — Handles all dynamic behaviour on the client side. This can be vanilla JS, React, Vue, or any other framework.
- **APIs** — Server-side logic is abstracted into reusable, third-party APIs accessed over HTTPS (auth, payments, search, comments, etc.).
- **Markup** — HTML is pre-rendered at build time, typically from Markdown via a static site generator like Hugo.

The key principle: **no web server renders HTML at request time**. Pages are already built and sitting on a CDN waiting to be served.

## How It Differs from Traditional Stacks

| | Traditional (e.g. LAMP) | JAMstack |
|---|---|---|
| HTML generated | At request time | At build time |
| Hosting | Web server (Apache, Nginx) | CDN (Netlify, Cloudflare) |
| Scaling | Requires server scaling | Automatic (CDN edge nodes) |
| Attack surface | Database + server exposed | No server, no database |
| Cost | Server costs | Often free for small sites |

In a traditional WordPress site, every page load triggers a PHP process, a database query, and HTML assembly — all in milliseconds, but under load it adds up. In a JAMstack site, the HTML is already there.

## The Build Process

The typical JAMstack workflow looks like this:

```
Developer pushes code
       ↓
CI/CD pipeline triggers (e.g. GitHub Actions, Netlify)
       ↓
Static Site Generator builds all pages (Hugo, Next.js, Astro)
       ↓
Output deployed to CDN edge nodes worldwide
       ↓
User requests → served directly from nearest edge node
```

Hugo is particularly well-suited here — it can build thousands of pages in under a second, keeping CI build times minimal.

## Where Does Dynamic Content Fit?

JAMstack doesn't mean no dynamic content — it means dynamic content is handled differently:

- **Comments** → Disqus, Utterances (GitHub Issues), or Staticman
- **Search** → Algolia, Pagefind (runs at build time)
- **Forms** → Netlify Forms, Formspree
- **Auth** → Auth0, Netlify Identity
- **E-commerce** → Snipcart, Shopify Storefront API

Each concern is delegated to a best-in-class API, rather than a monolithic backend doing everything.

## Why Use JAMstack?

**Performance** — Pre-built HTML + CDN = sub-100ms time-to-first-byte globally.

**Security** — No database, no server-side runtime, no attack surface. The most a compromised CDN can serve is static HTML.

**Developer experience** — Git-based workflows, instant rollbacks, preview deployments, and no server to manage.

**Cost** — Many JAMstack hosts (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages) have generous free tiers that handle significant traffic.

## Conclusion

JAMstack isn't a framework — it's an architectural philosophy. By decoupling the front end from the back end, pre-building all markup, and delegating dynamic functionality to APIs, you get a web stack that is naturally fast, secure, and easy to scale.

Hugo is one of the best entry points into JAMstack: it's a single binary, has no runtime dependencies, and produces optimised HTML in milliseconds.
